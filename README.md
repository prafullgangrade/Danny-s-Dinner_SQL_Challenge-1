**Introduction**

In this Task I try to solve and answer all query related to this task and find insights from data for answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

**Description**

Danny plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
